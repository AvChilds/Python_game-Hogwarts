## 🪄 About This Spellbinding Project

Welcome, young wizard! 🧹✨  
This was my **first magical journey** into building a Python app, and it's just the beginning!  
In **Level 1**, you’ll craft your own **Wizard Identity** and befriend another wizard from the wizarding world 🧙‍♀️🔮

🧠 **Skills learned:**
- API requests
- Random selection logic
- Python basics
- Building interactive terminal apps

## ✨ How It Works

Once you enter the game:
